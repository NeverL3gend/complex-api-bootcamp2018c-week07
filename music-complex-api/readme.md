## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a Complex API where we are grabbing the information about the artist and as well displaying the albums that they have released.

## Lessons Learned:

Using a Complex API grabbing two different type of information is pretty amazing because you are seeing two types of information coming from two different APIS and coming together and becoming one. When you are trying to combine two API I think it is best to make sure that they make sense and not just randomly putting two API together.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
